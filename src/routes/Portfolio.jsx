The user gets presented with the sweepstakes section first. They click to shake the tree and cash falls down and tallies up. The prize was made variable, ranging from $50,000-$100,000. Playing off of the excitement of the sweepstakes, we haloed the theme for the product section, giving the user a chance to shake the tree for a free gift order incentive. Users received either a $25 or $30 free gift value with their order based on their buyer segment with the most loyal customers revealing the highest amount. Design-wise, we kept it light and playful. We added a little birdie who “chirped” and relayed important UI messaging to the user. We even had elements like a boot falling out of one of the trees as a fun add-on.",

But at the same time, there was a strong sense of community across the country. People were (virtually) checking in on family, friends and neighbors and offering to help anyway they could. It gave me the idea to create an Americana-themed package with a strong sweepstakes offer that would give substantial financial relief and impact the winner's life in a positive way. This “positive impact” would help wipe out debt, cushion savings, even help out loved ones. Design-wise, we chose a red, white and blue color pallet with elements from our national landmarks.
